This directory contains ruby source files that define the available BUILT IN
sub-commands of the `leap` executable.

For example, the command:

  leap new <directory>

Lives in lib/leap_cli/commands/new.rb

However, most commands for leap_cli are defined in the platform. This
directory is `leap_platform/lib/leap_cli/commands`.

These files use a DSL (called GLI) for defining command suites.
See https://github.com/davetron5000/gli for more information.
